### 练习——Brainstorming
Eva spent the first week of high school trying to keep her head above water. One of the major headaches for her was finding her way in the huge school building. It was a six-story building. On each floor, hallways stretched in four directions, leading to classrooms, laboratories, and teachers’ offices. Somewhere in the building, there was also a library, a cafeteria, and a gym.<br/>
Having a poor sense of direction, Eva found it impossible to get around in such a huge building. All the different hallways and rooms were too much to think about, let alone commit to memory. She decided that she would memorize where her classes were and then pretend that the rest of the place didn’t exist.<br/>
In her fast P.E. class, Eva was shocked when Coach Pitt announced that everyone had to run one mile around the track outside. She searched the faces of her classmates for signs of panic. There was nothing she feared more than having to run a whole mile. To Eva, “a mile” was used to describe long distances. It was ten miles from her home to her grandfather’s, and that always seemed like a long way, even in a car!<br/>
When Coach Pitt blew his whistle (哨子), Eva figured she would be left in the dust. However, while some of her classmates edged ahead, others actually fell behind. “It’s just the beginning,” she thought. “I’ll come in last for sure.”<br/>
Soon Eva began to breathe hard, with her heart pounding and legs shaking. Feeling desperate, Eva started using a mind trick on herself. She stopped thinking about the word “mile.” Instead, she focused on reaching the shadow east on the track by an oak tree up ahead. Then she concentrated on jogging to the spot where the track curved (拐弯). After that, she tried to see if she could complete her first lap. One lap turned into two, then three, then four.<br/>
Paragraph 1: When Coach Pitt said “Nice work!” to her at the finish line, Eva was surprised.<br/>
Paragraph 2: Eva decided to use the same trick to deal with the school building.<br/>
**思考：这篇读后续写可能用到哪些谚语，什么情节，如何表达**
<br/>实例：1. Eva decided to use the same trick to deal with the school building. Practice makes perfect—by retracing the path to chemistry class daily, the turns soon felt like old friends.<br/>
2. Eva decided to use the same trick to deal with the school building. Rome wasn't built in a day, but after mapping one hallway each morning, the maze slowly became her kingdom.<br/>
3. When Coach Pitt said "Nice work!" to her at the finish line, Eva was surprised. It dawned on her that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step—and her first "step" was just an oak tree's shadow.
