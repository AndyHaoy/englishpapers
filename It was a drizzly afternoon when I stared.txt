It was a drizzly afternoon when I stared at the result of my third failed robotics competition, nearly ready to quit.
"It's too late anyway," I murmured. But my coach patted my shoulder: "It's never too late to start."
All of a sudden, I realized that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. From that day on, I arrived at the lab an hour earlier every morning—the early bird catches the worm.
Despite the difficulties, I kept telling myself: Rome wasn't built in a day.
Three months later, as our robot lifted the trophy steadily, it dawned on me that what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
And it all began with a single step on that rainy day.
